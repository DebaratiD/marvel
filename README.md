# Marvel Characters Project

Welcome to a fun project that I did - a repository on Marvel characters pulled from the Marvel Developers API. 

### Frameworks used:
- React.js
- Three.js (react-three/fiber)
- Motion (framer-motion)

This porject took me 24 hours to build, aided by Chatgpt for prompt responses on errors and potential fixes.

The website can be developed further, so feel free to fork and develop it!
